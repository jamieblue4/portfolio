        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>My name is Jamie Gist and I'm a self-taught web developer. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've don't have any professional experience yet, but I've built my own personal projects to learn more about programming. I'm hoping to land a job as a junior developer and learn even more about programming. My background is in English Literature and my hobbies are more to do with the visual arts.
