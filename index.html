        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>My name is Jamie Gist and I'm a self-taught web developer. I've don't have any professional experience yet, but I've built my own personal projects to learn more about programming. My background is in English Literature and my hobbies are more to do with the visual arts. So, learning how to code has been a good way to challenge myself and push my creativity to create things in new ways.</h3>
